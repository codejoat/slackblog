          <p class="post">Nothing to type today really. I spent yesterday morning on that other project, and let the guy know I had the bare bones of a site built for him. Now I just need to wait until he wants to see it. I don't have a laptop and I had to ressurect my old laptop, so that I could bring it with me. It's an old Dominator series MSI (somewhere around 10 years old, not sure), so it's still good. Those things were work horses. I did a lot of upgrades, so it still kind of feels current, except it won't take Windows 11. I've had Ubuntu and Slackware on it, but for now I just wanted easier access, and somewhat unfortunately, that's Windows. Anyways, After ressurecting the laptop, I got everything pushed to GitHub so that I can retrieve it from anywhere. What magical times we live in. Right now, and since I woke up extremely late, I am just waiting for my coffee to cool, so I can wake the fuck up and do some real work. So, if it feels like I am just typing words to type words, that's probably fucking why... Fuck you. Alright, had my first sip. Brain starting to do brain things. Later. One more thing, I was thinking about adding links to navigate the archive page, or at least make it easy to get back to the top of the page. Probably do that after launch.</p>

          <p class="post">Well, it was a pretty busy morning. I cleaned up the forms page and set up everything ready to show. It's just under 600 lines of code right now, and I think that's about enough. Anthing else is going to require some commitment to move forward. I could just use a site builder, like they did. All of YouTube seems to be telling people to masquerade as a programmer and then build sites on a site-builder like WIX or Wordpress. But, man, when I visited his site it was a mess. I am not trying to pick on people. They have to move forward in their ventures, and there isn't always a road map. But, this alone (comparing my simple and crappy site to one built by WIX), I would rather hire a real programmer. And this is not me bragging. I know I currently suck. I know I am a noob. And I know I couldn't build as complex a site as WIX. But the one instance I've seen just plain sucks. It's non-performant, I see 150+ errors everytime I open the dev-tools,  it's styling is bland at best, there is no real control for the client (as the client would actually have to know capabilities of web designers), and even small things like the box-shadows look like it's someone's first time using CSS. I understand that there is only so much you can program into a script that builds your site for you. But man, it really does show the limitations. People out there, please use a real programmer. It matters... at least a little.</p>
