          <p class="post">Yesterday, someone asked me to work on their website. I am a noob at this and felt like I would just disappoint them, so I gave them a lot of reasons why I probably wouldn't or couldn't do it. I did tell them that I would look at the current state of their site and get back to them. On my way home I decided that I would be stupid if I did't take this opportunity. So, when I got home, I really looked and didn't just give it a half assed take. There were a lot of issues. I stayed up unitl about 2am to build a quick skeleton of the site. I am going to work on my little blog for an hour or two (still planning to launch on Sunday) and then spend the rest of the morning on his site. Well, honestly I'm kind of interested in it, so I'll probably just spend the whole morning on his site.</p>
