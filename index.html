            <p class="post">Hello again. I don't have anything to say, except that I didn't post last night and I overslept this morning. To top it off, I decided to drink coffee and watch YouTube documentaries this morning... So now, I don't have much time to work. But, luckily I have been able to find a new bug in the CSS as I type this post. So, it gives me something to talk about. I use a border-bottom in CSS instead of a horizontal-rule in the HTML, so that I have better control over where it goes. Apparently, I fucked up, because it won't go below the bottom of the image until the text I type is long enough. And this, even though all are contained within the article tag and therefore class that describes the behaviour. Longshot, but I tried moving everything into a div, kinda figured it wouldn't work since an article is basically just a semantic div. Maybe copilot knows. Although, yesterday I asked it to proofread some stuff and it just made shit up. I am dead serious. I told it that I can't find the typos in question and it basically just said that I was right and those weren't there, lol. Why would it even be able to do this? Anyways, back to the h-rule problem...</p>

            <p>Less than 30 seconds later: Man, it can be quirky some times, but AI is the shit! If I asked this question on Stack Overeflow, I would probably be yelled at and told to go learn how to do it BEFORE I come there and ask how to do it. Seriously. If AI replaces one thing, I hope its assholes like that. With AI I ask and I shall recieve. I have literally read about 1500 pages in CSS and HTML and watch countless hours of YouTube and not once was "display: flow-root;" mentioned. Boom! And now, that will be in my brain for the next time. Let's be clear, I don't use AI to straight up build anything, but it (in spite of just straight up lying sometimes) is better than any book, teacher, video, or class that I have ever had. I wish I had used it more when I was learning C and C++. I might have already made a real product by now. It answers questions without hesitation or irritation. And most of the time, as long as the question is simple, it is accurate. I think that is the perfect use for it. It saves time from going through the books, finding the topic in the index, finding the chapter, trying to speed read to the topic at hand, and still not knowing if it's correct because there's no real feedback. But, just for show, I'll snip what Copilot wrote. Man, we are living in fucking good times. Fucking good and terrifying times. Alright, I have to go do something about having colors all over the place. They could just be set up as CSS variables. Then, I think I said something yesterday about Git. I still have to work, ha.</p>
