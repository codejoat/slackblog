          <p class="post">Nothing to type today really. I spent yesterday morning on that other project, and let the guy know I had the bare bones of a site built for him. Now I just need to wait until he wants to see it. I don't have a laptop and I had to ressurect my old laptop, so that I could bring it with me. It's an old Dominator series MSI (somewhere around 10 years old, not sure), so it's still good. Those things were work horses. I did a lot of upgrades, so it still kind of feels current, except it won't take Windows 11. I've had Ubuntu and Slackware on it, but for now I just wanted easier access, and somewhat unfortunately, that's Windows. Anyways, After ressurecting the laptop, I got everything pushed to GitHub so that I can retrieve it from anywhere. What magical times we live in. Right now, and since I woke up extremely late, I am just waiting for my coffee to cool, so I can wake the fuck up and do some real work. So, if it feels like I am just typing words to type words, that's probably fucking why... Fuck you. Alright, had my first sip. Brain starting to do brain things. Later. One more thing, I was thinking about adding links to navigate the archive page, or at least make it easy to get back to the top of the page. Probably do that after launch.</p>
