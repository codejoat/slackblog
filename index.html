          <p class="post">First GitHub commit for this project. Does it always feel like a pain in the ass, at first? I know it makes life worlds easier, but it's one of those things I usually dodge until I have to. I went through and cleaned up some code, and I have a few more things to add to the site before I launch, but so far I am pretty happy. I mean, it's just a bare bones blog, nothing special. But, I haven't ever actually followed through with something like this before. I guess we'll see this time. Ima take a coffee break.</p>

          <p class="post">I've been pacing back and forth. The site is not even close to being done, but I could launch it now. I'm scared. I'm 45 and I'm scared to launch a stupid fucking blog. Alright, after a few minutes of talking to myself, I am going to go with the original plan and launch Sunday. This will give me time to set up an email and a couple of other things for this site.</p>

          <p class="post">Been messing around with something and can't seem to get it to adjust exactly how I want it. I am going to call it good enough for now and come in later to put JavaScript to work on it. For now, it's been a less productive day than I hoped for, but more productive than I thought it was going to be, if that makes sense. Gotta go to work. I'll get this done up eventually. Goal is Sunday...</p>
